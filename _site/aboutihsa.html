      <p>The Intercollegiate Horse Show Association consists of a Western and an English division. 
      The team only competes in the English division. Within the English competition are different
      experience levels, organized from most advanced to least advanced.
      </p>
      <p>IHSA English Classes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li class="reasons">Open Fences/Flat</li>
        <li class="reasons">Intermediate Fences/Flat</li>
        <li class="reasons">Novice Fences/Flat</li>
        <li class="reasons">Advanced Walk/Trot/Canter</li>
        <li class="reasons">Beginner Walk/Trot/Canter</li>
        <li class="reasons">Walk/Trot</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In keeping with traditional equestrian competition, in which men and 
      women compete together on equal ground, IHSA equestrian competition is a 
      co-ed sport and does not discriminate based on gender.
      </p>

      <p>At IHSA competition, riders participate in a random draw from a pool of skill-matched horses.
      Competitors go into the show ring with no warm-up on the horse that they have drawn. This is
      the epitome of "catch riding". Riders are judged on their equitation and handling of the
      horse.</p>

      <hr><h2 class="intro-text text-center"><strong>A Typical IHSA Horse Show</strong></h2><hr>

      <p>Horse shows start with fences classes and end with flat classes. Each rider will randomly 
      draw a horse, which he or she will have to navigate around a course or show on the flat. This 
      is like extreme catch riding; no warm up or schooling is allowed, and prior to walking into 
      the arena, the rider is only allowed extremely light contact on the horse's mouth for safety 
      reasons. The rider is not allowed to put the horse on the bit or school him in any way (this 
      includes using a crop, or using one's leg as an aid) prior to walking into the arena. However, 
      riders are allowed to watch the host school warm up the horses prior to the start of the show.
      </p>

      <p>
      Guest schools are also provided with horse description lists which can give an idea of how 
      each horse must be ridden. Entries can be limited depending on the facilities and quantity of 
      horses the host school has access to. In order to create equal footing between large and 
      small schools, each school secretly selects one point rider per division, and that rider's 
      points alone will count towards the team's total points. Riders who are not selected as point 
      riders are still important, as they can steal points from other teams' point riders. 
      Individual riders can also gain points to point up from their division and qualify for the 
      Regional horse show at the end of the year.</p>

      <hr><h2 class="intro-text text-center"><strong>The End of the Season</strong></h2><hr>

      <p>At the end of the year, each team's total points from every horse show are counted 
      up, and the team with the most points is named Regional Champion. Individual riders who 
      have gained 36 points in their respective divisions and have therefore pointed up into 
      the next division qualify for the Regional horse show. These individual riders compete 
      for first or second place, which will send them to Zone Finals. The Regional Championship 
      Team will also go on to Zones, and at that horse show the top two teams and top two riders 
      from each Individual Class will go on to IHSA Nationals. The National horse show therefore 
      consists of Team Classes as well as Individual Classes.
