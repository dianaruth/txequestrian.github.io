                    <p>The time commitment for the team is a perfect balance between work and play, providing team members with several opportunities to ride, while still maintaining plenty of time for their studies.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Lessons</h3>
					<p>Team members are divided into lesson groups, taking a one hour-long lesson a week with the Coach. Beginner riders may need to take 30-minute private lessons before joining a group. If the Coach must cancel a lesson due to an emergency or unsafe weather conditions, the lesson will be rescheduled for a later date in the semester. If a rider misses their lesson, they are responsible to make up this lesson on their own. Make-up lesson weeks are provided at various times during the year. Open lesson spots due to rider cancellations can also be taken by a rider who needs to make up a lesson.<!-- Lessons are held at Sterling Hunter Jumpers Riding Stable.--></p>
					<br>
					<h3>Practice</h3>
					<p>Information on team practices coming soon.<!--Two team practices are held weekly, on Mondays from 5-7pm and Saturdays 10-noon. Practices are held at Sterling Hunter Jumpers and we typically use around 4 horses at each practice. Team members switch horses throughout practice, getting riding time on a few different horses to simulate an IHSA horse show experience. Attendance is mandatory for at least one practice per week.</p>
					<p>Note: For both lessons and practices, riders must commit additional time before and after the scheduled riding time. This includes grooming and tacking horses up before, as well as untacking and cooling down horses after. This adds an additional hour to lessons and practices (a half hour before and a half hour after).--></p>
