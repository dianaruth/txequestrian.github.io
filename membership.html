      <p>The time commitment for the team is a perfect balance between work and play, providing team members with several opportunities to ride, while still maintaining plenty of time for their studies.</p>

      <h3>Lessons</h3>
      <p>Team members are divided into lesson groups and take weekly lessons with the Coach. Beginner riders may need to take private lessons before joining a group. If the Coach must cancel a lesson due to an emergency or unsafe weather conditions, the lesson will be rescheduled for a later date in the semester. If a rider misses their lesson, they are responsible to make up this lesson on their own. Make-up lesson weeks are provided at various times during the year. Open lesson spots due to rider cancellations can also be taken by a rider who needs to make up a lesson. Lessons are held at Idylwood Stables.</p>
