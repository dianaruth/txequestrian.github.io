      <p>The Texas Equestrian Team competes through the Intercollegiate Horse Show
      Association (IHSA). The team rides and competes in hunt seat equitation both on the flat and
      over fences. Each year the team competes at different horse shows within our region in which
      both the team and the individual may gain points towards competing at Regionals or Zone
      Finals.</p>

      <p>At IHSA competition, riders participate in a random draw from a pool of skill-matched horses.
      Competitors, go into the show ring with no warm-up on the horse that they have drawn. This is
      the epitome of "catch riding". Riders are judged on their equitation and handling of the
      horse.</p>

      <hr><h2 class="intro-text text-center"><strong>Who can join</strong></h2><hr>

      <p>Any full time University of Texas at Austin undergraduate student is welcome to join.  
      Members do not need to own their own horse and only basic equipment is needed. Experience levels 
      range from those who have never had the chance to take up riding but still have a love of horses 
      and competition, to those who have successfully competed in upper level equitation and jumpers.</p>

      <p>Although we ride and compete in an industry competitive hunt seat equitation style (see Hunter 
      Seat Equitation, by George H. Morris), ALL disciplines are welcome and encouraged to join.  The team 
      provides a great social network as our season spans the entire school year, rather than just a semester.</p>

      <img class="img-responsive img-border img-left" src="img/meaganschooling.jpg" width="200" alt="">

      <p>Lessons, meetings, and shows are held throughout Fall and Spring Semesters.  Lessons may be continued 
      through winter, spring and summer breaks.  Members should expect to spend at least 3-5 hours each week 
      participating in team activities.  Most of our competitions require some length of travel.  We typically leave 
      for competitions on Friday afternoons (although Thursday afternoons are a possibility) and arrive back 
      very late on Sundays.</p>
