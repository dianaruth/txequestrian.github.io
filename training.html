					<h3>Lessons</h3>
					<p>Team members wishing to compete must participate in at least one lesson each week with the team coach. Beginner riders will ride in a 30-minute private lesson until they are able to join a group. Group lessons will last an hour with same skill level riders. During many group lessons, riders will switch horses multiple times to best simulate the IHSA competition format. Lessons may include work on the longe line, riding without stirrups, a variety of equitation exercises and tests, gymnastic jumping and course riding.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Group Practice</h3>
					<p>Team members wishing to compete must participate in at least one weekly group practice. Group practices are student led. 3-5 horses will be available and members are encouraged to switch horses, hold "mock" classes, school each other on the longe line, and work on individual skills.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Workouts</h3>
					<p>Riding is a sport and as such, participants must be physically fit and prepared to perform their best. The team has several members who are very experienced in fitness and can offer advice on exercises including cardio conditioning, core strength training, balance evaluation and training, and leg and upper body strength exercises. Workouts can be arranged with these members to improve riding strength as well as overall fitness.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>The Stables</h3>
                    <p>Facilities include a large sand arena with lights and a full course of jumps, a large round pen, 60'x100' covered arena, limited field riding, covered grooming and tack-up areas, metal and wood stalls, large tack rooms, wash racks, air-conditioned/heated club-room with restroom all in a friendly, family atmosphere.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>The Horses</h3>
					<p>The team rides the Sterling lesson horses during lessons and practices. Over a dozen lesson horses are available of different sizes and capabilities. All of the horses are show quality, kind and safe. All of our horses are patient, hard-working teachers and we are thrilled to be able to learn with them!

                    <p>The team is currently looking for a new barn. Check back later to see our new home for training.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Erin began riding at the age of 8 with Sally Francis, who is still her coach today. She owned
					several horses as a junior and helped to train many, from bringing along young horses to re-schooling
					race horses. Erin and her husband, Johnny, started their own business in 2006 and moved to their current
					property in 2007. Together, they have built an excellent facility and have put together a solid lesson
					horse string. Their business focus is to create a quality educational environment and to especially focus
					on an excellent lesson program geared primarily for those who cannot own their own horse.
					</p>
					<p>Erin has had extensive experience in competing in the hunter/jumpers up to A level and has attended
					clinics taught by professionals such as George Morris, Melanie Smith-Taylor, Peter Pletcher, Peter Leone,
					Daniel Stewart and more. She loves to ride, train, and show horses herself, but her greatest satisfaction
					comes from starting beginner students and seeing them progress as riders and horsemen, as well as fine
					tuning a students understanding and skills in equitation.
					</p>
					<p>As the head coach of the Texas State University Equestrian Team since 2009, Erin coached several riders
					to the National level and has has helped to create a respected program. Erin wants each student to enjoy
					learning about horsemanship, starting from the basics of proper horse management to finding balance and
					harmony while riding. She feels that what makes her different from other trainers is that she accepts the
					learning process and understands that each student will develop at their own pace. It isn't show-ring
					achievements or prizes that she strives for. Erin knows she is doing a good job when the student has a
					desire to continue learning with enthusiasm.
